# Census Data Analysis for Town Planning

## Overview

This project involved an analysis of mock census data for a fictional small town in order to provide data-driven policy recommendations to local government authorities. The goals were to advise on:

1. Optimal use of an unoccupied plot of land 
2. Public spending priority between employment retraining, elderly care, education, or infrastructure

Decisions were made by examining population trends, occupations, transit needs, income levels, age distribution, household sizes and other key indicators within the provided dataset.

## Data

The mock census data was structured to emulate the 1881 UK census, providing details on 9426 individuals including:

* Age
* Gender
* Occupation
* Marital status
* Religion
* Relationship to head of household
* Presence of infirmities

## Methods

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and formatting issues
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conducted overview analysis of demographics, occupations, incomes, religious affiliations and family structures
3. **Visualizations**: Generated plots highlighting insights 
4. **Recommendations**: Proposed land use and spending priorities based on evidence

* `census_data_cleaning.ipynb`: Data cleaning and preparation 
* `census_insights_analysis.ipynb`: Exploratory analysis and visualizations
* `Final_Recommendations.pdf`: Final land use and spending recommendations with discussion and plots

## Conclusions

* Construct **train station** to service likely student & workforce commuter demand 
* Prioritize **school infrastructure** investment given age distribution and large household sizes
* Limited evidence to support housing, religious or medical builds at this time
